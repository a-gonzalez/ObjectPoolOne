Big shout-out to https://www.youtube.com/@Frankslaboratory!! Thanks, Frank! Tu eres el mago.

From Frank:
Today we are building 2D animated space game with JavaScript and HTML canvas. We learned how to create asteroids using object pool design pattern, to improve performance and memory management of the codebase. Let me show a simple way how to handle multiple object pools, following good beginner friendly coding practices.  This project is beginner friendly. Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS & JavaScript is needed to get the maximum value.

Today we will learn:
- How to manage MULTIPLE object pools
- How to ANIMATE COLLISIONS from a sprite sheet
- How to add randomised SOUND EFFECTS
